        <p> In 21st Century the media has a wide spectrum to cover e.g.newspaper , television, radio, mobile, and <br>
            internet and so on and so forth. The Media Industry is going global, becoming digital and converging. <br>
            In our country Media Industry is growing at the rate of 20 percent per annum. Entertainment and media, <br>
            together, form the country's sixth biggest industry, with 3.5 million people working in it.
        <br>
        <br>
        <p> Within the next 4-5 years, the industry is expected to cross eighty thousand crores annually. Media organization <br>
            is now looking to optimize its reach across platforms such as newspaper, T.V., IPTV, Radio, Internet and Mobile. <br>
            As converging media (Cross Media) content involves more than one platform, so it has a high demand of <br>
            multi-skilled media persons.

     <br>
    <p> We believe that a combination of writing and production skills either in print, television or radio; <br>
        a broad understanding of the media and the ability to think critically are essential for people who <br>
        are planning careers in the rapidly evolving media industry.

     <p>Today fashion is seen everywhere. With rising income levels, growing 'Look Good, Feel Good' <br>
         attitude and development in the retail sector the fashion world indeed holds a good prospect. <br>
         It has almost become a fashion in the business to be in the business of fashion.<br><br>

        Fashion can be simple and yet so elegant. It was only in India where unstitched fabrics <br>
        created fashion for men and women that has been termed as the most innovative invention in <br>
        the world of fashion. The Indians mastered the art of draping fabrics around the body and <br>
        taught the world how a few yards of fabric like a sari or a dhoti or a shawl can make a <br>
        wonderful fashion statement.

            the history of women's fashion. Fashion creators of our country our master spinners, weavers, knitters and dyers, <br>
            were known the world over for their exquisite craftsmanship and skill. The blend of Indian and Western cultures <br>
            have made sarees and salwar kameez an international fashion statement. Ritu Kumar , Ritu Beri, Hemant Trivedi <br>
